# Description:  A ChessVar class that will allow two players to play a derivative of chess. In this version of chess, a
#               player wins by taking all of one type of chess piece. For example, you can win by taking both knights,
#               every single pawn, or just the queen. Also, the king is not a special piece, it still moves like a king,
#               but it cannot castle and there is no check or checkmate. Also, pawns cannot use en passant or pawn
#               promotion, however they can still move two places forward on their first move and still capture
#               diagonally.

class ChessVar:

    This class will be used to play the (derivative) game of chess.

    It will communicate with the children of the ChessPiece class to determine different aspects of a
    specific chess piece, such as what pieces each piece is allowed to capture and what moves it is allowed to make.

    each piece has different allowed moves, the is_move_legal method will work differently for each class but will
    always return True or False. This allows us to use polymorphism when checking if a pieces attempted move is legal.
